Privacy Policy

Adrian Stanescu built My M365 app as a commercial app. 

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my application.

If you choose to use my application, then you must know that the application stores iPhone locations for the past week only when it is connected to the scooter through Bluetooth.

All the data collected is stored on your device and it is not transmitted or used by anyone.

Every time the application starts it erases all the data older than one week.

Security

Your stored data is secured through the best solutions implemented in your iPhone IOS.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
